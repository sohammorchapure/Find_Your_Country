# 🌍 Find Your Country – REST Countries API with Theme Switcher

This is my solution to the [REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).

"Find Your Country" is a responsive web application that allows users to browse and search for countries using live data from the REST Countries API. The project includes region-based filtering, detailed country views with border country navigation, and a light/dark theme toggle to enhance user experience.

## 📌 Overview

The goal of this project was to fetch real-time country data and present it in a clean, user-friendly interface. This challenge helped me practice working with RESTful APIs, handling UI state with JavaScript, and implementing a theme switcher using CSS variables and localStorage.
