## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View all countries fetched from the REST Countries API
- Search for a country using a keyword input
- Filter countries based on regions (e.g., Africa, Asia)
- View detailed information of a selected country on a separate page
- Explore bordering countries by clicking on their names in the detail view
- Toggle between dark and light themes (optional feature)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/)
- Responsive Design Principles
- Theme toggling using CSS variables
- LocalStorage for persisting theme state

### What I learned

This project helped me understand how to:

- Fetch and manipulate API data dynamically
- Handle asynchronous operations using `async/await`
- Implement client-side routing/navigation
- Use `localStorage` to persist user preferences (like dark mode)
- Apply CSS custom properties for theme switching
- Create reusable and modular code structure

```js
const fetchCountries = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all');
    const data = await response.json();
    displayCountries(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching countries:', error);
  }
};
````

### Continued development

In future iterations, I would like to:

* Add animations for theme switching
* Improve accessibility (ARIA roles and keyboard navigation)
* Implement pagination for performance with large data
* Migrate to a frontend framework like React or Vue

### Useful resources

* [REST Countries API Documentation](https://restcountries.com/) ‚Äì for understanding API data structure.
* [CSS-Tricks: Dark Mode](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/) ‚Äì helped implement theme switching.
* [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) ‚Äì reference for JavaScript, CSS, and DOM operations.
